## Getting Started

In practice you should clone the repo and load the solution in VS 2017, copile it and run it

### Prerequisites

You shouldn't need to install anything before. Just compile and run the exe. Be sure to provide the proper params

## Tests made

I tested the app on win10 x64 - x64 version - so at least this should work fine
For win32 I don't map more than 1GB of large files
I tested this on c:/windows without any crashes and with good results
The maximum file size I tested it was 2.7GB and contained only one line with the needle at the end
